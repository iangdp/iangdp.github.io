This post includes my name, my year, my majors, my sewing experience, my programming experience, what I hope to learn in this class, and one boring fact about me.

**Sewing Experience**

I have zero sewing experinence. Zilch. Nada. I did however go through a knitting phase in the 5th grade. My grandma taught me how to knit and we would make hats and scarves together. 


**Programming Experience**

I took computer science in 9th and 10th grade. Resultantly, I have some experience coding in CSS and Arduino. If I'm being honest though, I don't remember much from those classes. More recently I have done some coding in SPSS for my Psychology major but I'm not sure if that exactly counts as programming. 

**What I hope to Learn in this Class**

I have minimal experience coding and zero experience sewing. By the end of the semester I know this will change, which is why I am so excited for this class! 

**Boring Fact About Me**

I know how to operate a toaster oven!
