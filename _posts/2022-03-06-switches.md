This post includes a picture of the front and back of my light up project, a photo of the worksheet, a description of the project and a tip/hint I would give to my past self to help them complete this deliverable. 
 
This project was designed to give us practice with stitching conductive thread in creative ways (i.e. the making of a homemade stitch).

**Tip for my past self**

Align the battery in the right way to start!
