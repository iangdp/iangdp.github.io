Unsurprisingly, Williams College is #1 in the most recent edition of US News and World Report's rankings of liberal arts colleges. Arch rivals Amherst lag behind at #2.

**Why Williams?**

Williams boasts a 7:1 student to faculty ratio and a robust financial aid program. Situated in the beautiful Berkshires of Western Massachussets, Williams should be at the top of the list for any high schooler interested in going to college. 

## Here is a secondary heading

Here's a useless table:

| Number | Next number | Previous number |
| :------ |:--- | :--- |
| Five | Six | Four |
| Ten | Eleven | Nine |
| Seven | Eight | Six |
| Two | Three | One |


How about a yummy crepe?

It can also be centered!

Here's a code chunk:

~~~
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
~~~

And here is the same code with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
```

And here is the same code yet again but with line numbers:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
{% endhighlight %}
