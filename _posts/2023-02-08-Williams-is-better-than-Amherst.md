Unsurprisingly, Williams College is #1 in the most recent edition of US News and World Report's rankings of liberal arts colleges. Arch rivals Amherst lag behind at #2.

Williams boasts a 7:1 student to faculty ratio and a robust financial aid program. Situated in the beautiful Berkshires of Western Massachussets, Williams should be at the top of the list for any high schooler interested in going to college.
