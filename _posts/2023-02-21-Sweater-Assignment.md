This post includes a description of this assignment, a screenshot of my output, and a tip/hint I would give to my past self while completing this deliverable.
 

**Assignment Description**

This programming deliverable was designed by Professor Howley to help us students get practice with if/then statements. If / then statements will be important going forward when making a wearable elctronic device.

**Output Screenshot**

**Tip for my past self**

Put your else statement at the end of all the other statements or else your program will ignore statements after it!
