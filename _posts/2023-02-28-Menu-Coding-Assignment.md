This post includes a description of this assignment, a screenshot of my output, and a tip/hint I would give to my past self while completing this deliverable.
 

**Assignment Description**

This programming deliverable was designed by Professor Howley to help us students get practice with nested if statements. It mimicks a restaurant menu and the output changes based on a "customers" meal choice and number choice.

**Tip for my past self**

Using proper indentations makes it so much easier to read yor code!
