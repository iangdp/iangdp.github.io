This post includes a description of this assignment, photos of my 3 working sets of LEDS, and a tip/hint I would give to my past self while completing this deliverable. 
 
This program was designed to simulate different colored LEDS turning on in the pattern of different fireflies. This assignment gave us practice coding in Arduino!
