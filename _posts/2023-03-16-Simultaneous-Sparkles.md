This post includes a description of this assignment, a photo of my working sets of LEDS, and a tip/hint I would give to my past self while completing this deliverable. 
 
This program was designed to simulate different colored LEDS turning on in the pattern of different fireflies. This assignment gave us practice coding in Arduino!

**Tip for my past self**

Use unique variable names in individual files so when you want to combine code from different files it is easy!
