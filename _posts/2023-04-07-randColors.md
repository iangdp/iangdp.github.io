This post includes a description of this assignment, a photo of my working on-board RGB LED, and a tip/hint I would give to my past self while completing this deliverable. 
 
This program was designed to make an RGB LED flash up with random colors whnever a button is pressed.

**Tip for my past self**

Make sure to close all circuits on your board or else the code won't matter!
