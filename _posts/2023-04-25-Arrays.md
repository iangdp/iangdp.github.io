This post includes a description of this assignment, a photo of my Arduino setup, and a tip/hint I would give to my past self while completing this deliverable. 
 
This program was designed to randomly turn on an analog output to a random level from 0-255.

**Tip for my past self**

Don't try to write to the buzzer using analog write! You need to use tone!
