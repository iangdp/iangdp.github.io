**Project Title: The Reset Button**

**Description**
The reset button is a wearable wrist device involving a light sensor, a button, a RGB LED, and a buzzer. When the light sensor is covered and the button is pressed, the RGB LED flashes blue for 4 seconds, and blue for 8 seconds to guide a breathing exercise (breath in for 4, hold for 7, breath out for 8). When light sensor is not  is flipped and the button is pressed, the buzzer sounds off “RESET’ in morse code.


**Motivation**
The idea of the reset button comes from my coach who always stresses that we reset mentally after making a mistake on the field in order to perform better on subsequent plays. I think this idea can and should be used by people in all contexts, and my device will help them do so!

**Materials List**
1. Purple Felt
2. RGB LED
3. Lilypad Light Sensor
4. Lilypad Temperature Sensor
5. Lilypad Button
6. Conductive Thread
7. Needle
8. Scissors
9. Portable Battery

**Resources Used**

Thank you to professor Howely for the example code she has posted on Glow! I specifically relied on Pogil Arrays, Buzzer-Sound, and Temperature-Sensor.
