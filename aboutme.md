Did you know that wearable technoligies have become more and more popular, and that this trend is expected to continue? As of 2022, there were more than **1.1 billion** connected wearable devices worldwide. (https://www.statista.com/statistics/487291/global-connected-wearable-devices/) 

Electronic textiles are fundamental for the development of wearable devices. I am taking this course because I want to learn the programming, sewing, and circuitry skills necessary for the creation of wearable devices. I love wearable devices, and I think it would be really neat to make my own.
